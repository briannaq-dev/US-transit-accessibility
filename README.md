# US-Transit-Accessibility: Comparing transit accessibility across U.S Metro Areas by Cities, Income-Level, and Time
### Project for DS4200: Information Presentation &amp; Data Visualization SEC 01 F2025

## Introduction
Public transit plays a vital role in connecting people to jobs, education, and essential services, yet access to reliable transit remains highly uneven across U.S. metropolitan areas. Understanding these disparities is crucial because transit accessibility directly influences economic mobility, quality of life, and social equity. This project explores and compares how easily residents and workers in major U.S. metro regions can reach employment opportunities within a 45-minute commute by transit and walking. By examining these differences, our analysis highlights how variations in transportation infrastructure can shape opportunity and reveal which regions promote inclusive, sustainable growth and which continue to leave communities behind.

Our dataset, Access to Jobs and Workers via Transit, was published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and was retrieved from Data.gov. It is distributed as a File Geodatabase Feature Class, however, we are using a converted CSV file version so that it would be possible to analyze and visualize the data using Python tools. The dataset provides a comprehensive measure of transit accessibility for neighborhoods (Census Block Groups, or CBGs) across the United States. It was developed to compare how effectively public transit connects residents and workers to employment opportunities within metropolitan areas.

## Objectives
Determine the following:
1. Which metro areas provide the highest and lowest overall accessibility to jobs.
2. How accessibility differs between income groups (low-wage vs. all workers).
3. Whether there are regional trends linking transit access with population density or urban size.
