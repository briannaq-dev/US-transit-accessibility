    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Understanding transit accessibility in the United States is essential for
            evaluating how transportation systems shape <b>economic opportunity</b>, <b>mobility</b>,
            and <b>quality of life</b> across metropolitan regions. Public transit is a critical
            connector between residents and employment centers, yet the degree to which
            people can reliable reach jobs varies widely from city to city. Transit
            accessibility measures how many job opportunities an individual can reach
            within a reasonable travel time–in this case, within 45 minutes via transit
            and/or walking–and serves as a meaningful indicator of <b>urban infrastructure
            performance</b>, <b>workforce inclusivity</b>, and <b>regional equity</b>.</p>

            width="550"
            class="spacing-y"/>
        <p>Monitoring differences in transit accessibility provides insights into broader
            social and economic outcomes, such as workers’ ability to reach <b>stable employment</b>,
            the effectiveness of <b>local transportation investments</b>, and the extend to which
            cities support <b>upward mobility</b>. High levels of job accessibility often reflect
            efficient transit networks, compact urban design, and equitable transportation
            planning. These factors can strengthen regional labor markets and support
            long-term economic growth. Conversely, low accessibility may signal geographic
            isolation, underinvestment in transit services, or disparities that affect
            low-income communities and essential workers.</p>
        <p>Transit accessibility also intersects with socioeconomic factors such as income,
            housing, and spatial inequality. Metro areas with limited job access via transit
            may experience increased financial strain on households, reduced employment
            stability, and greater dependence on personal vehicles, which can burden
            disadvantaged communities. Examining how these disparities helps identify
            which regions foster inclusive mobility and which are falling behind in providing
            equitable access to opportunities.</p>
        <div class="block">
            <p>To learn more about transit accessibility and national mobility patterns,
            additional information can be found through organizations such as the
            <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> and the
            <a href="https://www.bts.gov/">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>.

        <h2>Our Data</h2>
        <p>For our data, we used two datasets, both collected by the EPA.
            The first dataset is called <mark class="code">smartlocation.csv</mark> and the second
            dataset is called <mark class="code">sld_trans45.csv</mark>. The detailed information
            about the features used throughout this project is listed in
            the following table:</p>

                As students who live in Boston, we were extremely shocked to see that the public
                transit in Boston did not appear in the top 10 metro areas that had the highest
                job accessibility through public transit.
