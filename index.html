    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Understanding transit accessibility in the United States is essential for
            evaluating how transportation systems shape <b>economic opportunity</b>, <b>mobility</b>,
            and <b>quality of life</b> across metropolitan regions. Public transit is a critical
            connector between residents and employment centers, yet the degree to which
            people can reliable reach jobs varies widely from city to city. Transit
            accessibility measures how many job opportunities an individual can reach
            within a reasonable travel time–in this case, within 45 minutes via transit
            and/or walking–and serves as a meaningful indicator of <b>urban infrastructure
            performance</b>, <b>workforce inclusivity</b>, and <b>regional equity</b>.</p>

            width="100%"
            class="spacing-y"/>
        <p>Monitoring differences in transit accessibility provides insights into broader
            social and economic outcomes, such as workers’ ability to reach <b>stable employment</b>,
            the effectiveness of <b>local transportation investments</b>, and the extend to which
            cities support <b>upward mobility</b>. High levels of job accessibility often reflect
            efficient transit networks, compact urban design, and equitable transportation
            planning. These factors can strengthen regional labor markets and support
            long-term economic growth. Conversely, low accessibility may signal geographic
            isolation, underinvestment in transit services, or disparities that affect
            low-income communities and essential workers.</p>
        <p>Transit accessibility also intersects with socioeconomic factors such as income,
            housing, and spatial inequality. Metro areas with limited job access via transit
            may experience increased financial strain on households, reduced employment
            stability, and greater dependence on personal vehicles, which can burden
            disadvantaged communities. Examining how these disparities helps identify
            which regions foster inclusive mobility and which are falling behind in providing
            equitable access to opportunities.</p>
        <div class="block">
            <p>To learn more about transit accessibility and national mobility patterns,
            additional information can be found through organizations such as the
            <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> and the
            <a href="https://www.bts.gov/">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>.

        <h2>Top 10 Metro Areas for Job Accessibility via Public Transit</h2>
        <p>This graph introduces the overall landscape of transit accessibility by highlighting the
            top ten metro areas with the highest percentage of jobs reachable within a forty-five-minute
            transit commute.
        <p>The results show that many of the strongest performers are smaller or mid-sized
            regions such as <b>Corvallis</b>, <b>Missoula</b>, and <b>Butte Silver Bow</b>. These areas demonstrate that high job
            accessibility often emerges when residential density, employment locations, and transit routes
            are closely aligned. In these regions, the physical distance between where people live and where
            jobs are located is short enough for transit to function efficiently, which helps explain why they
            rise to the top of the ranking.</p>
        <p>This graph establishes a foundation for understanding how local
            geography and urban structure influence access to employment.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Map View of Job Accessibility via Public Transit</h2>
        <div id="choropleth">
            <p>
                Knowing <b>Corvallis, OR</b> had the highest average percentage of jobs reachable
                through public transit, we wanted to understand the data in the larger picture by
                creating a choropleth map.
                </p>
            <p>The choropleth map of Oregon shows a more fragmented distribution of transit
                accessibility across the state. Only a few concentrated areas around Portland,
                Salem, and Eugene appear in the highest accessibility category,
                while the majority of block groups fall into the lowest tier. This pattern
                reflects Oregon’s more rural and dispersed development structure, where job
                centers and residential areas are spread farther apart and transit coverage
                is less continuous. Even in regions with stronger service, high accessibility
                is limited to isolated pockets rather than forming a broad and cohesive network.
                These characteristics help explain why most Oregon metropolitan areas do not rank
                highly in overall job accessibility, despite some urban centers providing well-connected
                transit corridors.
            </p>
            <img
                src="outputs/map_accessibility_or.png"
                width="600"
                class="spacing-y"
                style="border:none;"
            ></img>
            <p>
                In contrast, the map of <b>Massachusetts</b> displays much wider and more continuous areas of high
                transit accessibility, particularly in and around Greater Boston and along the major transit
                corridors that extend outward from the city. Large regions of the state fall into the upper
                accessibility categories, indicating a denser and more interconnected transit network. Yet,
                despite this strong spatial coverage, Massachusetts does not appear among the top metro areas
                for jobs reachable within forty five minutes.</p>
            <p>Massachusetts also operates on a <a href="https://www.mbta.com/fares/subway-fares">fare based
                transit system</a>, while Corvallis <a href="https://www.corvallisoregon.gov/cts/page/cts-fundingfares">provides free public
                transit</a>, which lowers barriers to use and encourages higher ridership. As a result,
                metro areas like Corvallis, where jobs, residents, and free transit services are tightly
                concentrated, can achieve higher overall job accessibility than larger regions with broader
                but more dispersed networks such as Massachusetts.

    <!-- Side by Side Bar Chart -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Comparing largest disparities in job accessibility via public transit by wage</h2>
        <p>
            The side by side bar chart explores socioeconomic issues by comparing job accessibility
            for low wage and medium wage workers in the metro areas with the largest differences.</p>
        <p>
            In many of the regions shown in the chart, low wage workers actually have access to a
            higher percentage of jobs within a forty five minute transit commute when compared to
            medium wage workers. Cities such as Bloomington, Blacksburg, Fayetteville, Ann Arbor,
            and Champaign Urbana all show this pattern, which suggests that jobs available to lower
            wage workers may be located closer to dense housing or situated along transit routes with
            more frequent service. Only a few metro areas, including Salina, Springfield, and Reno Sparks,
            show the more common pattern where medium wage workers have an advantage.</p>
    
        <div id="barplot"></div>
        <p>This variation demonstrates that transit accessibility does not follow a single national trend and instead
            depends on how each region organizes its job locations and transit network. The chart
            highlights that some metro areas may be supporting mobility for low wage workers more
            effectively than expected, while others continue to show gaps that affect both equity
            and opportunity.

    <!-- Selecting States for Walkability Score -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Understanding walkability versus population density</h2>
        <p>The scatterplot represents the relationship between walkability scores and population
            density across metro areas, allowing users to filter by state. The pattern shows a
            clear upward trend, indicating that more walkable places generally have higher population
            densities. Most points cluster lower to moderate walkability levels with modest densities,
            while a smaller number of states reach both high walkability levels and high density. This
            relationship aligns with the idea that compact development supports pedestrian activity,
            shorter travel distances, and greater access to daily destinations. This matters because
            dense and walkable environments reduce reliance on automobiles, lower transportation costs
            for residents, and create settings where transit, biking, and walking become realistic daily
            options.

    <!-- Slider Scatterplot Zero-Car Households -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Understanding the relationship between walkability and zero-car households</h2>
        <p>To further explore the relationship between the walkability of a metro area and the average
            percentage of zero-car households, we wanted to use a slider interactivity to see the population
            for that metro area. It appears that the <b>New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ Metro Area</b> has the
            highest population for a metro area with over 19 million residents, an average
            percentage of 27.5% for zero-car households, and a walkability score of 12.6 out of 20.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the graph, we can also see that the metro area with the lowest percentage of zero-car households
            is <b>Breckenridge, Colorado</b>, with a percentage of 0.98%, demonstrating high car dependency.
        </p>
        <div class="block">
            <p>Walkability Scores are calculated from 0-20.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>To interact with the graph, use the slider below to adjust the cutoff for population size.</p>
            <div id="scatterplot" class="spacing-y">
                <iframe
                src="outputs/slider_scatterplot_zero_car.html"

                height="400"
                style="border:none;"
                ></iframe>
            </div>
        <p>
            This connection highlights how walkable environments reduce the need for personal vehicles and support alternative modes of travel.
            The slider interaction reinforces this relationship by showing that as the minimum population threshold
            increases, data points that have higher populations tend to have higher walkability scores. Recognizing how walkability supports zero-car
            living helps policymakers and planners understand the importance of designing
            neighborhoods that allow residents to meet their daily needs without relying on expensive and energy-intensive transportation.

    <!-- Conclusions & Summary -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion and Summary</h2>
        <p>The visualizations in this project show how transit networks, land use patterns, and socioeconomic factors work together to shape access to opportunity
            across metropolitan regions. The transit accessibility results reveal that strong job access occurs when residential areas, employment centers, and transit
            routes are closely aligned, which is why compact cities such as Corvallis outperform larger regions. The comparison between Oregon and Massachusetts highlights
            how development patterns influence accessibility, showing that even areas with broad transit coverage may have lower job access if destinations are dispersed or
            if barriers such as fare-based systems limit ease of use. The wage-based analysis adds another dimension by revealing that transit access varies across income
            groups, demonstrating that local planning and job geography can either support or restrict the mobility of lower-wage workers.</p>
        <p>
            The walkability findings further emphasize how built environments shape daily mobility. Higher walkability is strongly associated with greater population density and a
            higher share of zero-car households, showing that compact neighborhoods make it easier for residents to meet daily needs without relying on a private vehicle.
            This matters for affordability, environmental sustainability, and equitable access to essential destinations. Overall, the patterns across these graphs illustrate that
            effective transportation planning depends on integrating transit, land use, and neighborhood design in ways that expand opportunity, reduce transportation burdens, and
            support more equitable and connected communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, we would have wanted to include an interactive map that would allow users to zoom into counties within states and view any significant data about public
            transit, walkability, and job accessibility through the map to boost visual interactivity.
